  # Pod requests impossible amounts of CPU and memory
  # No Kubernetes node will have these resources available
  # Pod will permanently remain in Pending state
  # Scheduler will never be able to place this pod
  # Events will show "Insufficient memory" and "Insufficient cpu"
  # This tests cano-collector's handling of permanently unschedulable pods
