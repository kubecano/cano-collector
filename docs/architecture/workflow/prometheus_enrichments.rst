Prometheus Enrichment Workflows
===============================

Prometheus enrichment workflows provide advanced capabilities for enriching alerts and events with Prometheus metrics, graphs, and analysis.

Prometheus Enrichments
----------------------

**Purpose**: Provides comprehensive Prometheus metric enrichment for alerts and events.

**Trigger**: Fires on Prometheus alerts or metric requests

**Actions**:
- Queries Prometheus for relevant metrics
- Generates metric graphs and charts
- Provides metric analysis and trends
- Shows historical metric data
- Generates metric enrichment reports

**When it runs**: Triggered when Prometheus enrichment is requested

**Output**: Prometheus metric enrichment with graphs and analysis

Prometheus Simulation
---------------------

**Purpose**: Simulates Prometheus queries and provides testing capabilities.

**Trigger**: Fires on simulation requests

**Actions**:
- Simulates Prometheus queries
- Tests query performance
- Validates query syntax
- Provides query optimization suggestions
- Generates simulation reports

**When it runs**: Triggered when Prometheus query simulation is requested

**Output**: Prometheus simulation report with performance analysis

Target Down Enrichment
----------------------

**Purpose**: Analyzes Prometheus target down scenarios.

**Trigger**: Fires on target down alerts

**Actions**:
- Analyzes target down causes
- Provides DNS resolution information
- Shows network connectivity details
- Identifies target configuration issues
- Generates target down analysis reports

**When it runs**: Triggered when Prometheus targets go down

**Output**: Target down analysis report with troubleshooting information

CPU Throttling Analysis
-----------------------

**Purpose**: Analyzes CPU throttling issues in containers.

**Trigger**: Fires on CPU throttling alerts

**Actions**:
- Analyzes CPU throttling patterns
- Provides CPU usage metrics
- Shows throttling history
- Identifies throttling causes
- Generates CPU throttling reports

**When it runs**: Triggered when CPU throttling is detected

**Output**: CPU throttling analysis report with optimization recommendations

Overcommit Enrichments
----------------------

**Purpose**: Analyzes resource overcommit scenarios.

**Trigger**: Fires on overcommit alerts

**Actions**:
- Analyzes resource overcommit patterns
- Provides resource usage metrics
- Shows overcommit history
- Identifies overcommit causes
- Generates overcommit analysis reports

**When it runs**: Triggered when resource overcommit is detected

**Output**: Overcommit analysis report with optimization recommendations

Configuration
-------------

Prometheus enrichment workflows can be configured through Helm values:

.. code-block:: yaml

   workflows:

         enabled: true
         defaultDuration: "1h"
         includeGraphs: true
       prometheusSimulation:
         enabled: true
         timeout: 30
       targetDownEnrichment:
         enabled: true
         includeDNSInfo: true
       cpuThrottlingAnalysis:
         enabled: true
         includeMetrics: true
