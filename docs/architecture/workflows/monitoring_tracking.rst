Monitoring and Tracking Workflows
=================================

Monitoring and tracking workflows provide capabilities for tracking changes, monitoring resources, and maintaining audit trails in Kubernetes clusters.

Resource Babysitter
------------------

**Purpose**: Tracks changes to Kubernetes resources and provides detailed change analysis.

**Trigger**: Fires on Kubernetes resource changes

**Actions**:
- Monitors resource changes in real-time
- Captures detailed change diffs
- Provides change analysis and impact assessment
- Shows change history and timeline
- Generates change tracking reports

**When it runs**: Triggered when Kubernetes resources are created, updated, or deleted

**Output**: Resource change report with detailed diff and analysis

Resource Events Diff
-------------------

**Purpose**: Provides detailed diff analysis of resource changes with before/after comparisons.

**Trigger**: Fires on resource change events

**Actions**:
- Generates detailed diffs of resource changes
- Shows before and after resource states
- Highlights significant changes
- Provides change impact analysis
- Generates diff reports

**When it runs**: Triggered when resource changes are detected and diff analysis is requested

**Output**: Resource diff report with detailed change analysis

Change Tracking
--------------

**Purpose**: Maintains comprehensive audit trails of all resource changes in the cluster.

**Trigger**: Fires on any resource change event

**Actions**:
- Records all resource changes with timestamps
- Maintains change history and audit trails
- Provides change search and filtering
- Shows change patterns and trends
- Generates audit reports

**When it runs**: Triggered for all resource changes when change tracking is enabled

**Output**: Change tracking report with audit trail and history

Resource Monitoring
------------------

**Purpose**: Provides continuous monitoring of resource health and status.

**Trigger**: Fires on resource status changes or monitoring intervals

**Actions**:
- Monitors resource health and status
- Tracks resource metrics and performance
- Identifies resource issues and anomalies
- Provides health status updates
- Generates monitoring reports

**When it runs**: Triggered on monitoring intervals or resource status changes

**Output**: Resource monitoring report with health status and metrics

Event Tracking
-------------

**Purpose**: Tracks and analyzes Kubernetes events for patterns and issues.

**Trigger**: Fires on Kubernetes events

**Actions**:
- Collects and analyzes Kubernetes events
- Identifies event patterns and trends
- Provides event filtering and search
- Shows event correlation and relationships
- Generates event analysis reports

**When it runs**: Triggered when Kubernetes events occur and event tracking is enabled

**Output**: Event tracking report with analysis and patterns

Audit Logging
------------

**Purpose**: Provides comprehensive audit logging for compliance and security purposes.

**Trigger**: Fires on resource operations and access events

**Actions**:
- Logs all resource operations with details
- Tracks user access and permissions
- Provides audit trail for compliance
- Shows security-related events
- Generates audit reports

**When it runs**: Triggered for all resource operations when audit logging is enabled

**Output**: Audit log report with compliance and security information

Configuration Tracking
---------------------

**Purpose**: Tracks configuration changes and provides configuration drift analysis.

**Trigger**: Fires on configuration changes

**Actions**:
- Monitors configuration changes
- Identifies configuration drift
- Provides configuration validation
- Shows configuration history
- Generates configuration reports

**When it runs**: Triggered when configuration changes are detected

**Output**: Configuration tracking report with drift analysis

Configuration
-------------
