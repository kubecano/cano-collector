DaemonSet Workflows
==================

DaemonSet workflows provide comprehensive monitoring and management capabilities for Kubernetes DaemonSets, including status analysis, scheduling monitoring, and troubleshooting.

DaemonSet Status Enricher
------------------------

**Purpose**: Provides detailed analysis of DaemonSet status and scheduling.

**Trigger**: Fires on DaemonSet events or status requests

**Actions**:
- Analyzes DaemonSet status and conditions
- Shows pod scheduling status
- Provides DaemonSet configuration details
- Identifies scheduling issues
- Generates status analysis reports

**When it runs**: Triggered when DaemonSet status analysis is requested or DaemonSet events occur

**Output**: DaemonSet status report with detailed analysis

DaemonSet Misscheduled Analysis
------------------------------

**Purpose**: Analyzes DaemonSet pods that are misscheduled on nodes.

**Trigger**: Fires on DaemonSet misscheduling events

**Actions**:
- Identifies misscheduled DaemonSet pods
- Analyzes misscheduling reasons
- Provides node scheduling information
- Shows scheduling constraints
- Generates misscheduling analysis reports

**When it runs**: Triggered when DaemonSet pods are misscheduled

**Output**: DaemonSet misscheduling analysis report with troubleshooting information

DaemonSet Pod Analysis
---------------------

**Purpose**: Analyzes pods managed by DaemonSets.

**Trigger**: Fires on DaemonSet pod events

**Actions**:
- Lists all pods managed by the DaemonSet
- Analyzes pod status and readiness
- Provides pod resource usage information
- Shows pod scheduling details
- Generates pod analysis reports

**When it runs**: Triggered when DaemonSet pod analysis is requested or pod events occur

**Output**: DaemonSet pod analysis report with pod details

DaemonSet Rollout Monitor
------------------------

**Purpose**: Monitors DaemonSet rollouts and provides progress updates.

**Trigger**: Fires on DaemonSet rollout events

**Actions**:
- Monitors rollout progress in real-time
- Shows pod status during rollout
- Identifies rollout issues and delays
- Provides rollout timeline
- Generates rollout progress reports

**When it runs**: Triggered when DaemonSet rollouts are initiated or in progress

**Output**: DaemonSet rollout progress report with status updates

DaemonSet Health Analysis
------------------------

**Purpose**: Analyzes DaemonSet health and identifies potential issues.

**Trigger**: Fires on DaemonSet health events or analysis requests

**Actions**:
- Analyzes DaemonSet health status
- Identifies health issues and warnings
- Provides health recommendations
- Shows health metrics and trends
- Generates health analysis reports

**When it runs**: Triggered when DaemonSet health analysis is requested or health events occur

**Output**: DaemonSet health analysis report with recommendations

Configuration
-------------
